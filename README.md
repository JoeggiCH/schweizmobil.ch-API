# schweizmobil.ch-API
Unofficial API documentation and python example

I love hiking and cycling in Switzerland. I love https://map.schweizmobil.ch because it offers excellent maps and track suggestions.

With a paid subscription (currently 35 CHF per year) hiking, cycling, tracks can be created and managed.
This repo contains a postman 2.0 Collection JSON describing the API for managing tracks and a demo in python.

Please note that I am not affiliated in any way with schweizmobil.ch foundation and this repo is not an official publication of schweizmobil.ch. I created this repo for my training and because I was unable to find any documentation on the API.
