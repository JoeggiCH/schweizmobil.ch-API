# schweizmobil.ch-API
Unofficial API documentation and python example

I love hiking and cycling in Switzerland. I love https://map.schweizmobil.ch because it offers excellent maps and track suggestions.

With a paid subscription (currently 35 CHF per year) hiking, cycling, tracks can be created and managed.
This repo contains a postman 2.0 Collection JSON describing the API for managing tracks and a demo in python.
